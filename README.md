# twitterBackend
# Assignment Overview:

This assignment involves building a simple backend application for managing users and tweets. The purpose of the application is to allow users to sign up, sign in, add tweets, and fetch tweets. It serves as a basic example of how to implement user authentication and manage tweet data using a Node.js backend with Express and MongoDB.

# How to Run the Application:

Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory: cd <project-directory>
Install dependencies: npm install
Start the server: npm start
The server should now be running locally. You can use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints.

# Dependencies:

Express: for building the web server
Mongoose: for interacting with MongoDB
Bcryptjs: for hashing passwords
Jsonwebtoken: for managing authentication tokens

# Installation Instructions:

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run npm install to install all dependencies.

# Configuration:

Ensure that you have a .env file in the root directory of the project with the required environment variables like PORT and CONNECTION_URL for configuring the server and MongoDB connection respectively.

# Testing:

There are no specific tests included in this assignment. However, you can manually test the application by sending requests to the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.

# Issues and Troubleshooting:

If you encounter any issues during installation or running the application, ensure that all dependencies are properly installed and configured.
Common issues might include incorrect configuration settings in the .env file or issues with MongoDB connection. Double-check these settings and try restarting the server.
If you encounter any errors, refer to the console output for more information and consult the relevant documentation for troubleshooting steps.
